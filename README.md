- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisbitter
- 🦁 I'm currently working as a Senior Robotics and AI Engineer at Circu Li-Ion on the automation of battery disassembly for up- & recycling
- 🎓 I'm also working on my dissertation with the preliminary title "Cross-Domain Deep Transfer Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Robotics" with Prof. Tobias Meisen
  - 💡 tldr: How can we make deep reinforcement learning more efficient and applicable for industrial robotic use-cases? By leveraging knowledge gained from simulations, other tasks and even other robots?!
- 👀 I’m interested in
  - 🤖 teaching robots new skills
  - 🌍 real-world applications of machine learning
  - 🐟 automation of [aquaponic systems](https://aachen-eden.de/)
- 💻 I'm mainly working with [pytorch](pytorch.org/) and [pybullet](https://pybullet.org/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAX
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to cross-robot skill learning/transfer!
