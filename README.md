- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisbitter
- 🎓 I'm currently working on my dissertation with the working title "Physically-informed cross-robot transfer learning in reinforcement learning"
  - 💡 tldr: How can experience (policies, expert trajectories) be transfered between robots of different morphology, i.e. different state and action spaces
  - 🏁 I plan on finishing summer 2023
- 👀 I’m interested in
  - 🤖 teaching robots new skills
  - 🌍 real-world applications of machine learning
  - 🐟 automation of [aquaponic systems](https://aachen-eden.de/)
- 💻 I'm mainly working with [pytorch](pytorch.org/) and [pybullet](https://pybullet.org/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAX
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to cross-robot skill learning/transfer!
